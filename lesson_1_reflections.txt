syntax of DIFF -u is a bit rough to decode from bash prompt

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you 
a more efficient programmer in the long term?

back history on how a problem was solved is good
to refresh self when re-visiting code in future!

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, 
like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

logically sensible points to return to, but maybe not the EXACT place where
errors happened.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files

using GIT LOG - can look thru comments to find possibly useful ID's
then GIT DIFF that ID verses older (lower in list) one to see changes
